lt-wordcount
===========

Light table plugin for showing a live wordcount in another tab.

I made this plugin as the simplest plugin that would actually do something, as an example for everyone.

Restart Light Table before you can use it.

Shamelessly inspired by / ripped off from [lt_markdown](https://github.com/MarcoPolo/lt-markdown).
